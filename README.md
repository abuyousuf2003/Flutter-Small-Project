# AppCount

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A simple Flutter app that displays a counter with an increment button. When the button is pressed, the counter increases by 1. This app demonstrates basic state management using StatefulWidget and the setState method.

Features:

Basic Flutter setup with MaterialApp and Scaffold.
Counter that updates dynamically when the "+" button is clicked.
Custom AppBar with color and shadow effects.
This project is a great starting point for beginners learning Flutter state management and UI building.
